## Installation

This application is run through the command-line. To use this application, clone and download the files from this repository. Additionally, run 'npm install' to install the packages included in the package.json (required packages are mysql, inquirer, dotenv, and console.table).

The trackerSeeds.sql file can be used to easily populate a MYSQL database. 
Create your own .env file to contain your database host, user, and password.
    
## Usage

Once everything is downloaded and installed (and the database has been created using the trackerSeeds.sql as a base), get the application running by typing "node employeeTracker.js" into the command-line. The application will then prompt you for what you would like to do. 

Cycle through the options by using the arrow keys and enter to select. View, add, or delete departments, roles, or employees â€” update employee roles and managers - or view department budgets. The application will update your database as you make changes.
